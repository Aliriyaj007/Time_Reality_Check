# ⏱️ Time Reality Check

> **See how long tasks actually take — and fix your planning bias permanently.**

A lightweight, offline-first tool that helps you compare **estimated vs actual time**, identify **systematic bias**, and **calibrate future estimates** — without accounts, backends, or noise.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most people don’t fail at productivity.
They fail at **time estimation**.

Before this tool, people:

* Guess task durations optimistically
* Miss schedules repeatedly
* Blame discipline instead of calibration
* Use bloated apps that track *everything except reality*

Existing tools focus on **tracking time**, not **fixing estimation bias**.

> **This tool exists because planning fails when estimates aren’t grounded in reality.**

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

* Tracks **estimated vs actual time** per task
* Shows **rolling estimation bias (last 7 tasks)**
* Breaks bias down by **task category** (Study / Work / Personal / Admin)
* Suggests **next estimate adjustments** automatically
* Provides a **weekly bias snapshot (Mon–Sun)**
* Enforces focus with a **locked focus overlay**
* Works **fully offline** in a single HTML file

### What It Does *Not* Try to Be

* ❌ A task manager
* ❌ A habit tracker
* ❌ A gamified productivity app
* ❌ A cloud-based analytics dashboard

This is a **calibration instrument**, not a lifestyle app.

---

## 🔁 Before / After

### ❌ Before

* Manually guessing task duration
* Overrunning schedules
* Constant re-planning
* No idea *where* estimates go wrong
* Time wasted fixing plans instead of improving them

### ✅ After

* One action: **Estimate → Work → Stop**
* Immediate reality check
* Automatic bias detection
* Clear next-estimate suggestions
* Zero setup, zero friction

## 📤 Sample Output

```text
Task: Study Algorithms
Estimated: 30 min
Actual:    42 min
Difference: +12 min

Rolling 7-task bias: Underestimate ~18%
Study category bias: Under ~22%
Next suggested estimate: 37 min
```

Weekly snapshot:

```text

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

* [x] Estimation vs actual tracking
* [x] Rolling bias analytics
* [x] Category-wise calibration

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Works on a single device (by design)
* No cloud sync
* No multi-user support
* Bias accuracy improves only with usage

This is a **personal calibration tool**, not a team dashboard.
